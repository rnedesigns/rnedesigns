### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I work on the web development and software testing projects, Data Analyst, Data Science enthusiast - will embrace working on open source projects & participation in coding community activities.
Worked on the Data Science curriculum project for its content creation, presentation, moderation for the Python community group with an Organization.. I develop, host & manage the websites for my clients, writing tech blogs & works on my mob apps side projects

Participated in the Hackathon project of Data Analysis by Women in data and TruCue team. That was to analyse provided covid19 dataset and I contributed by adding additional sets for further support and to prepare the report, visualization graphs and presentation about the descriptive and some of diagnostic parts of the analysis. Worked with Python, Jupyter Notebook, Excel and Tableau. It was a great experience to meet new people and team!
