### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Ramya, motivated Individual, working on the web development and software testing projects, Data Analyst, Data Science enthusiast - will embrace working on open source projects & participation in coding community activities.
Worked on the Data Science curriculum project for its content creation, presentation, moderation for the Python community group with an Organization.. I develop, host & manage the websites for my clients, writing tech blogs & works on my mob apps side projects

I have participated in the Hackathon project of Data Analysis - It was an amazing experience. Worked on covid19 datasets and great experience as a team member, from my previous experience it was a great pleasure to work on this project and helped me to learn it in further more details. As a team, we chose to analyse the provided dataset on a covid-cases data as a base to analyse on the diagnostic and descriptive aspects of the Data Analysis w.r.t the countries who provided the data during the crisis to understand the aspects of which countries doing well during this crisis, what was the learnings during the ease of lockdowns, which country is male or female leaded, rules/measures implied by each country, total cases and total deaths, government effectiveness and their performance w.r.t the GDP along with how the political decisions affected the counties well-being during this global crisis. Along with this base dataset, I also added additional datasets and worked together to gain the insight into the factors mentioned above. Earlier I have worked using Python, Excel and CRUD operations using SQL, through this hackathon I had an opportunity to learn using the tools such as Tableau, Alteryx and exposure to Power BI for visualizations & presentation aspects with GUI based analysis..
